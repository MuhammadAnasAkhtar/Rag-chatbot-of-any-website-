# RAG Chatbot Description
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot that enables users to query information sourced from specific websites. The chatbot is built using Streamlit for the interface, LangChain for building the retrieval and response pipeline, and Chroma for storing and retrieving document embeddings. It provides concise and contextually relevant answers by combining document retrieval and OpenAI’s language model for response generation.

# Key Features
Web-Based Chat Interface:

Interactive user input for queries with responses displayed in real-time.
Document Retrieval:

Fetches and processes data from provided website URLs using UnstructuredURLLoader.
Text Chunking:

Splits large documents into smaller pieces using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for improved search and retrieval efficiency.
Vector Database:

Stores document embeddings in a Chroma database for similarity-based retrieval.
AI-Powered Responses:

OpenAI’s GPT model generates concise answers based on retrieved document chunks.
Customizable System Behavior:

A predefined system prompt guides the chatbot to provide short, accurate, and context-based answers.
# How It Works
URL Processing:

Documents are loaded from specified URLs and prepared for analysis.
Text Splitting and Embedding:

Documents are split into smaller chunks and converted into vector embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval.
User Query:

Users submit questions via the chatbot interface.
RAG Pipeline:

Relevant document chunks are retrieved from the vector store.
The OpenAI model generates an answer based on the retrieved context.
Response Delivery:

The chatbot displays a clear and concise response to the user.
